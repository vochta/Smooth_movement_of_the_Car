Sensor readings with offsets:	6	-6	16387	-1	-1	0
Your offsets:	-5858	1349	1190	25	45	44

Data is printed as: acelX acelY acelZ giroX giroY giroZ
Check that your sensor readings are close to 0 0 16384 0 0 0
If calibration was succesful write down your offsets so you can set them in your projects using something similar to mpu.setXAccelOffset(youroffset)
